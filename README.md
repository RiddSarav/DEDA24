guys, 

there are 2 files you have to use, master.py and then como.py. 

master.py will get the bumpiness and append it to a DB where como.py will then print the read the DB cross check the bumpiness and then return you the route that avoids all those roads.

first run master.py and collect all the data then AT THE SAME TIME, run como.py and type in where to where you want to go. 

It's all command line for now, if you guys want you can try to make it different and use a website, but I think we can just say that the product is still in testing and we will add a web interface later.



BTW: YOU NEED TO DOWNLOAD THIS ENTIRE DIRECTORY AND THEN RUN IT, FOR SOCKETS, IF ON A WINDOWS MACHINE: ipconfig /all  (LOOK FOR WHERE IT SAYS, "IPV4. THEN USE THE PORT, 2217. TYPE IN THE IPV4 ADERESS YOU GOT INTO THE RASPBERRY PI, AND INTO THE MASTER.PY FILE.
