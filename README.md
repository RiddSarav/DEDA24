guys, 

there are 2 files you havr to use, master.py and then como.py. 

master.py will get the bumpiness and append it to a DB where como.py will then print the read the DB cross check the bumpiness and then return you the route that avoids all those roads.

first run master.py and collect all the data then AT THE SAME TIME, run como.py and type in where to where you want to go. 

It's all command line for now, if you guys want you can try to make it different and use a website, but I think we can just say that the product is still in testing and we will add a web interface later.
